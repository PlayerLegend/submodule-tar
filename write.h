/**
   @file tar/write.h
   This file describes the public interface for the writing portion of the tar library.
   To write a tar file, first use tar_write_header or tar_write_path_header to generate a header for the item you are trying to write to your tar file. Then, if this item is a file, longname, or longlink, write its contents to the tar and use tar_write_padding to write the necessary padding after it. To terminate the tar file, use tar_write_end.

   @brief This is a keyargs function used to write a tar header into an output buffer.
   @return True if successful, false otherwise
   @param output This is the output buffer into which the header will be written. 
   @param name This is the full path of the item described by the new header.
   @param mode This is the permissions mode to be indicated by the new header.
   @param uid This is the user id to be indicated by the new header. It can be left as 0 if uname is given as an argument.
   @param gid This is the group id to be indicated by the new header. It can be left as 0 if gname is given as an argument.
   @param size If the new header is describing a file, longname, or longlink item, then this will indicate the size of the item. For other types of tar items, this should be left as 0.
   @param mtime The last time that the file was modified, in epoch seconds.
   @param type The type of this item - this argument accepts values enumerated in tar_type. However, TAR_ERROR and TAR_END may not be used here, and their use will result in an error.
   @param linkname If the new header is describing a hardlink or symlink, this indicates the destination it points to.
   @param uname This is the user name to be indicated by the new header. It overrides uid if both are given.
   @param gname This is the group name to be indicated by the new header. It overrides gid if both are given.
